# Leinad Shop Backend

**Leinad Shop Front-End** is the client-facing component of the Leinad Shop marketplace platform. It's designed to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly interface for browsing products, registering, managing their accounts, and making transactions. This project was created by Reth with the aim of transforming the market, but unfortunately, it never reached the production stage. However, after some time, we've chosen to make it accessible to the public and convey our vision to the world.
